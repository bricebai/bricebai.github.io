## Challenge

**Background**

> “A visual novel is an interactive game genre, which originated in Japan in the early 1990s, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels.”

– [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel)

**The problem:** As a personal fan of visual novels, I struggled with finding more that were available in English. There was definitely a growing demand—I saw more and more Japanese titles fan-translated into English in my personal search, but I still felt unsatisfied with the present titles available, especially for adolescent players. I decided to take matters into my own hands and make one of my own.

## The Team

While we all had a hand in everything, here are some of our official titles:

**Brice (me)** - Project Manager, Writer, Social Media Manager, Audio Editor

**CatharsisGaze** - Artist & UI designer, Proofreader/Editor, Beta Tester, Audio Editor

**Rexx9224** - Programmer

**na-o-mi** – Artist

**IridescentFlora** – Assisting artist

This was how we all worked together:

## Observations and Research

[According to Reddit user /u/Noslyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/2navwt/the_statistics_of_visual_novels_on_steam/), there were only 59 English visual novels on gaming platform Steam as of November 2014. Companies like JAST USA and MangaGamer provided English localizations of popular Japanese visual novels as well, but both primarily released erotic 18+ games. English fan translations of visual novels also existed, but downloading and accessing them was often a complex, multi-step process that was not easy for a casual player.

I wanted to create a visual novel that was free, easily accessible across different computer platforms, available in English, and open to a younger audience.

## Features

Some features of our visual novel were designed especially to create better experiences for players:

* **Fan Art Gallery** - a page to recognize the art of the characters made by our fans
* **Music Box** - a page where players can unlock soundtracks as they play and listen to them on their own
* **Partially-Voiced Character Voiceovers** - professional and amateur voice actors who were willing to provide voiceovers for some characters are included
* **Original Music Soundtracks** - original music just for Nova made by composers Dorrell Ettienne and Allan Newman
* **Animated Opening Title Sequence** - a semi-animated opening to the game, using an original soundtrack as its theme
* **German and Portuguese translated demo version** - the introduction of the game is made available to German and Portuguese speaking fans; artists CatharsisGaze and na-o-mi are from Austria and Brazil respectively, so they were willing to translate!

Beyond the visual novel itself, our team wanted to create more fan engagement as we were in the process of development. I posted bi-monthly social media updates across 5 platforms informing our followers of our most recent progress and released an art preview. We also held an online DeviantArt fan art contest that gave artists the chance to win prizes and learn more about our game.

### Challenges

The main challenges I faced were finding the right people to work with and staying committed to the project for over four and a half years.

I did not have possess all the skills needed to create a visual novel, so I had to seek help from others, but no one around me was interested in the project. I ended up turning to the projects section of a DeviantArt forum, posting a help wanted thread that solicited a few private messages from some users.

Despite how none of had ever made a visual novel nor completed a project to this scale before, we still managed to complete it together in due time.

Building my team from that forum became the most significant factor of my learning experience and growth—it was my team members that taught me how to set proper goals and deadlines for myself, how to communicate ideas with people across different disciplines, and how to work well as a team despite being fully remote and never once meeting at the same time. Making Nova proved to me that working with others will often create something bigger and better than what one person can do alone, giving me a much greater appreciation for teamwork and collaboration. Ultimately, it was my team that motivated me to continue working on this project for so long. I wanted to be accountable for starting it, and I became determined to have our hard work come to fruition.

In managing the project and leading the overall direction of the game, this is what started my interest in the product field in the tech industry. It gave me direct experience in creating and releasing a product from start to finish, designing the product and its features with the user in mind, working with a team and dipping into every facet of the product development process, and managing it all under a personal timeline while still being a full-time student.

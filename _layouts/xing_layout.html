<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Skin. It’s the largest organ of the human body, and can be the biggest source of frustration for anyone who has been a teenager and even beyond. From walking into the confusing skincare aisles of a CVS to seeing endless online advice for using over 10+ products at once, my entire team has experienced the same frustrations over finding what works best for us.</p>

<p><strong>How can we make it easier for people to explore skincare and find the products that work best for them?</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>For people frustrated with the current overcomplicated skincare landscape, create a product that makes
  acquiring skincare knowledge more accessible, affordable, and attainable.</p>

<h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>

<p>Our team all met via Yale Launch, a student entrepreneurship club dedicated to helping students create ventures and startups. All of us loved skincare and wanted to tackle a problem in this realm. While we all did not have definitive roles and worked on much of the observations, research, and first product prototyping together, each of us had special backgrounds that contributed to our product in different ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Brice (Me)</strong> - Project Manager and UI/UX Designer</li>
  <li><strong>Gauri</strong> - Chemistry and finance background</li>
  <li><strong>Xiaoke</strong> - Marketing and startup background</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="observations-and-research">Observations and Research</h2>

<p>We released a user survey to gather data on the 30 respondents’ current skincare beliefs, 
  which confirmed our observed pain points, led to discovering the different types of users, and guided our design decisions.</p>

<h3>The top reasons respondents lacked a routine were that it was too time-consuming, too confusing to approach, and too overwhelming.</h3>

<div class="prose mb-2 pb-4">  

<p>These complaints highlighted the target pain point my team found. Skincare, especially for beginners, seems like too much of a hassle to learn about.
  There needs to be a solution that makes it simpler for people to learn about their skin and start their own routines.</p>

<p>For our first prototype, we wanted to create a skincare product, so we were interested in researching what product features users were most interested in. Separate data from users with skincare routines and users without skincare routines were collected. Market research on the skincare was also conducted.

<p>Using a series of four online recipes (<a href="https://www.humblebeeandme.com/lavender-cleansing-milk/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebeeandme.com/gentle-chamomile-facial-cleanser/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebeeandme.com/houdini-anti-acne-creme/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebeeandme.com/lemon-rose-facial-lotion/">4</a><a href="">)</a> from blogger <a href="https://www.humblebeeandme.com/">Humblebee &amp; Me</a>, our team prototyped a batch of cleansers, toners, and moisturizers. We chose this blogger for her beginner-friendly and ingredients-focused recipes. Her website had extensive information on proper ingredient sourcing, preservation of products, recipe troubleshooting, and safety precautions, so we felt that she was a trusted source.</p>

<p>We formed a beta testing group of 12 from our original survey respondents. Half of the testers used our “normal” skin type set, while the other half used our “acne” skin type set. Within each group, half of the normal set used X.ing products alone while the other other incorporated X.ing products into their currently existing routine. The half that used the products alone either did not originally have a routine at all or were skincare beginners willing to try a complete new routine.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/xing_proto1_1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Overall positive feedback on our prototype was expressed.</p>

<p><strong>However, our team faced difficulty in further product development due to lack of mentorship and experience in cosmetic formulations.</strong></p>

<p><strong>These limitations and further discussion with the beta testing group users led us to discover another pain point that users had</strong>—the frustrations from not having convenient, reliable sources of help in discovering products or improving their routines.</p>

<p>Although the internet contains a plethora of reviews, advice, and suggestions for different products, 
  our users expressed more trust and a preference for help from friends or family—ultimately, 
  people with whom they had a personal connection with and could actually look at their skin and assist them. 
  They wanted better access to specialized, personal attention on their skin.
  Some had even expressed a better way to access dermatologists or other skincare professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Since users expressed a desire for simplicity in regards to learning about skincare,
  a mobile app was chosen for its ease of direct messaging users and sending images</strong>. 
  Providing images of your own skin or products is a specific and significant supplement beyond 
  pure description to diagnosing and treating skin issues. A mobile app platform makes this experience 
  easier than a website.</p>

<h3 id="design-decision-2">Design Decision 2</h3>

<p>Users can toggle between friends and skincare professionals to message. 
  <strong>Because users expressed interested in forming connections with other people interested in skincare,
    one-on-one messaging is the main method of communication in order to encourage more personal relationships 
    between users</strong>–this is the main reason why a forum or public question submission feature is not included.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="design-decision-3">Design Decision 3</h3>

<p><strong>When finding users, you automatically are shown people who will give you what you seek</strong>, 
  whether it be advice or someone to advise. <strong>The option to filter by age, location, skin type, or knowledge 
  level is available</strong>, as these are important factors to treating different skin conditions at certain ages 
  or in certain climates. <strong>This is particularly helpful to users who have concerns that are based on these factors.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/3.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="design-decision-4">Design Decision 4</h3>

<p>Your profile will contain the key information for others to learn about your skin and assist you. 
  <strong>Users from the survey and beta testing were key to deciding what information to include.</strong>
    They expressed particular interest in having a biography to showcase their personality and pique the interest of other users. 
    Having the user’s skincare knowledge level also gives others an extra parameter in determining how much to trust the user’s opinion.</p>

<p>The other key feature here is <strong>having succinct FAQs and introductory guides</strong> to skin type, 
  skin concerns, and routine formulation available as cards that overlay the screen. 
  <strong>It creates a better learning experience, especially targeting beginner skincare users.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/4.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="design-decision-5">Design Decision 5</h3>

<p>Inspired by the MyFitnessPal user-generated food library, <strong>X.ing implements a user-generated skincare product library</strong> 
  instead. This allows for easy adding of your own products and the ability to discover new products with real feedback.
  <strong>One common complaint from users in the survey and beta testing was the hassle of looking up ingredients and organizing
    the product's information. The user-generated product library reduces this trouble.</strong></p>

<p>Another key chat feature is the ability to send product cards from your routine or the product library in direct messages. <strong>This eliminates the extra time and effort spent in looking up products online, allowing users to easily view product information without leaving the platform.</strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: none;" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F740E4HfxK12Hw5aBVIhiQz%2FX.ing%3Fnode-id%3D4%253A0%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <h2>Results and Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      With our first prototype, our biggest limitations came from a lack of available mentorship and experience in cosmetic formulations. Although we were able to prototype and test two working sets of products, we had difficulties in moving beyond the first iteration. In addition, further discussion with users gave us new perspective on their pain points and goals towards building a routine. These new perspectives on how users desire to seek help and find products led us to pivot towards a new solution that was also more feasible with our current skillsets and resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Future Directions</h3>
    <p>
      Since our second prototype was a spinoff of our first and the only additional user research was collected from discussions with a limited number of people, more research on how users obtain their skincare information and preferences should be conducted, from both our personal peers as well as active users of online skincare communities.
      <br><br>
      Another point of consideration is researching more reasons for why more experienced skincare users would use this platform. Newbie skincare users benefit from gaining personal advice on how to start and maintain a routine, but more established users have different incentives towards participation in this type of social network. Interviews of experienced skincare users who are active contributors on online skincare communities should be conducted to discover their motivations towards being so active and willing to assist others.
      <br><br>
      Here are some remaining use cases and considerations that I would also like to flesh out:
      </p><ul>
        <li> <u>Professionals.</u> More research on professionals' incentives to use this kind of platform and how they envision themselves engaging with new or current patients/clients should be conducted. Would they only use it to communicate with patients, or would they also use it to find friends? Should there be an option for them to have a network of friends and patients or only have a network of patients alone?</li>
        <li> <u>Group chat.</u> Currently, one-on-one messaging is the main form of communication, but having group chat support is another avenue of communication that still aligns with our value proposition. What kind of scenarios would group chat trump both one-on-one messaging or forum thread posts? This is a situation where the personal connection among users will matter more in order to form a group chat.</li>
        <li> <u>Profile.</u> Are there any additional parameters to include in the profile to help users decide whether to trust another user and add them to their networks?</li>
        <li> <u>User discovery.</u> What additional ways can users find friends and professionals to add to their network besides the current discovery method? Would the inclusion of a forum or public question submission area be beneficial in discovering new users, or would it reduce the amount of private messaging and interactions?</li>
        <li> <u>Platform misuse.</u> How can we reduce the risk of users abusing the platform to promote their own business or social platforms?</li>
    </ul>

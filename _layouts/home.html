              <p>The design and layout of the Kenz tab in Harbinger flows smoothly and offers easy "at a glance" high level overviews of what the current state of impact is. The 'Untagged potentially impacted services' is supremely helpful in assisting to identify other potential problems or even possible root causes. The design is well thought out and polished up nicely. With a few minor tweaks and additions it would be very nearly perfect.</p>

      <p style="width: 25em;">I’m a UX Designer at Amazon Web Services.
        Previously, I was a student at Yale University who studied Computing and the Arts, a joint computer science and art major. 
     

      <br><br>Whether I'm developing interactive stories or prototyping products, designing in Figma or drawing with my Wacom tablet, 
        I've always been a creator at heart. This combined with my background in computer science and visual arts has led me to become 
        passionate about creating impactful, accessible, and delightful experiences for all.</p>

    <p><br>When I’m not designing,
    you can find me dancing, doodling cartoons, and learning how to cook new recipes.</p>
    
    <p>Let’s get in touch if you have a project / collaboration in mind. Or if you just want a coffee chat. :)</p>

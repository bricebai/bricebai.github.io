      <p style="width: 25em;">I’m an undergrad at Yale University (‘22) studying Computing and the Arts, a joint computer science and art major. 
      Previously, I've worked at Amazon Web Services and GlowTouch.

      <br><br>Whether I'm developing interactive stories or prototyping products, designing in Figma or cutting away with my Xacto knife, 
        I've always been a creator at heart. This combined with my background in computer science and visual arts has led me to become 
        passionate about creating impactful, accessible, and delightful experiences for all.</p>

    <p><br>When I’m not designing, coding, or serving as VP of <a href="https://uxsocietyyale.org/">UXSociety at Yale</a> 
    you can find me dancing to kpop with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB92sVSL5aiv5a8Myl8WRRw">Yale Movement</a>, doodling cartoons, and penny boarding down the street.</p>
    
    <p>Let’s get in touch if you have a project / collaboration in mind. Or if you just want a coffee chat. :)</p>

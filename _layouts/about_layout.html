              I'm a UX designer based in Seattle, Washington with an affinity for discovering hidden customer needs and 
              transforming them into clever solutions. Currently, I'm designing for Amazon's Worldwide Prime team. 
              Previously, I worked on UX for Enterprise cloud optimization support tools in AWS.
              <br><br>
              While my career in design began at Amazon, my love for the field began at Yale, where I pursued a joint art 
              and computer science degree. I've now cultivated diverse experiences ranging from B2B SaaS products, video 
              room platforms, to VR simulations.

      Beyond UX, I’m an artist and storyteller at heart. A dance studio is my second home, where aerial arts 
      and ballet keep me off my feet. I'm also constantly looking for great dessert spots in Seattle. Give me your recs!

    <p>I’ve always considered a personal website as your digital house on the world wide web—a house that anyone can walk into, 
      has limitless rooms, and rolls up the interior decor in CSS. I welcome you into my corner of the internet, 
      but please take your shoes off. :)

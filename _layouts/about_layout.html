      <p style="width: 25em;">At AWS, I'm a UX Designer who specializes in designing for external and internal users of 
        large-scale cloud optimization platforms. Triangulating customer, business, and technical needs while prioritizing 
        usability and joy is what I strive for when delivering results.
    
      <br><br>My education at Yale and past work have provided me with diverse experiences in end-to-end UX projects ranging from 
        B2B SaSS products, D2C mobile/web apps, and virtual reality experiences. I’m passionate about utilizing my creative and 
        analytical skills to develop innovative and impactful products in tech.</p>

    <p><br> Besides my professional interests, I’m an artist and storyteller at heart. When I’m not designing,
    you can find me dancing, doodling cartoons, and learning how to cook new recipes.</p>

## The Challenge

**Background:** HiveDesk is a B2B SaaS product that tracks remote worker productivity by taking random automated screenshots of workers’ screens. It has a customer base in the hundreds and is managed by a small team in GlowTouch Technologies, a technology company based in Louisville, Kentucky. As a summer 2019 intern at GlowTouch, I had the opportunity to assist with the product marketing and management of HiveDesk.

**The Problem:** HiveDesk has been stagnating in customer growth for over a year. One way to tackle this issue is through small and easy-to-implement UI/UX techniques that influence users to move beyond the homepage and to the free trial download page. I redesigned the homepage with this intention of increasing user conversions and free trial downloads.

## Observations and Research

I analyzed the current version of the homepage and researched various psychological and marketing techniques. A couple of factors immediately stuck out to me that could be changed:

* **Less is more—the overall amount of information on the page should be reduced to increase the user's focus on the primary goal**. Most notably, the numerous links in the navigation bar, as well as the heavy-text descriptions of the product and the company, are extraneous. Users have limited focus, so they should have their attention pointed towards the most important information and the main call to action—starting a free trial. By having a more focused page with fewer links and text, conversions are more likely to increase.


* **Attention needs to be more easily directed to the call-to-action, especially at the top of the funnel**. Adjustments relying on tactics such as the mere exposure effect by repeating the CTA button will influence users more easily. Adding more attention especially at the beginning of the conversion funnel, when users first land on the page, will help increase conversions in further stages of the funnel.

## Features and Prototyping

I implemented numerous UI/UX changes across the page. These changes intentionally appeal to the product’s target users, emphasize the CTA button, encourage users to continue scrolling down the page, and overall direct the user to the main goal.

## Final Design

Although the page’s UI was not completely changed, small changes to the current page such as the reduction of links in the top navigation bar and the removal of the extraneous blocks of descriptive text were made. The CTR from homepage to free-trial-page as well as the number of users scrolling down the entire homepage increased.

## Results and Learnings

Redesigning the homepage showed me how just a few simple changes could be the deciding factor in whether a user chooses to try out a product or not. If the user cannot be properly convinced to use the product, it will struggle to gain more users.

In the future, one thing I would like to A/B test is the opening headline and header image that the user first sees upon homepage arrival. The original homepage had a headline that described what the product itself was and had a header image of the product’s dashboard pages in the background. I intentionally chose a headline that focused on the target user’s expected desires and chose a header image that would direct attention to the CTA button. Gathering data on whether these changes actually increased conversion rates would provide stronger support for their implementation.

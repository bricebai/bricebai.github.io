## Challenge

**Background**    In the fall semester of my sophomore year at Yale, I had the pleasure of taking “The Mystery of Sleep”, a cognitive science course that covered the science behind sleep. The knowledge I gained about the importance of sleep made a huge impact on me—studying the research on the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation as well as the benefits of a consistent sleep pattern helped push me to seek ways to improve my own sleep.

Many products exist to improve sleep quality, but not many are designed with the intent of improving chronic sleep deprivation or creating real behavioral change. **I want to design an easy way for people to not only achieve better sleep but to also develop better sleep habits that will improve their overall sleep quality in the long run.**

## Observations and Research

Sleep is often not prioritized, especially in a college environment, but taking this course has proven to me that this is definitely not the right attitude that people should hold. Through **user interviews** and **secondary research**, I saw the need for an easy way for people to consistently achieve better sleep.

### User Interviews

I interviewed 5 people–4 were my friends and classmates, and 1 was my sister who had been facing severe sleep problems. I noticed a few common findings among them:

* **All were unsatisfied with their sleep.**

### Secondary Research

A 2017 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5350571/) led by Diana S. Grigsby-Toussaint, a kinesiology and community health professor from the University of Illinois, on the 35 most popular sleep apps confirms the sentiment that there is still room for improvement for sleep apps. Although the study found that the majority of apps were well-designed and allowed its users to set goals and track their sleep, **very few apps had features that supported long-term behavioral changes**. Out of all 35 apps, only:

* 4 apps provided information about the benefits of sleep
* 4 apps provided information about the risks of sleep deprivation
* 6 apps offered reminder messages for sleep
* 1 app gave positive reinforcement for reaching a sleep goal

Integrating these features into a sleep app will help people develop better, more sustainable sleep hygiene that will improve their overall quality of life.

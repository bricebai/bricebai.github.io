## Challenge

**Background**: Skin. It’s the largest organ of the human body, and can be the biggest source of frustration for anyone who has been a teenager and even beyond. From walking into the confusing skincare aisles of a CVS to seeing endless online advice for using over 10+ products at once, my entire team has experienced the same frustrations over finding what works best for us.

We wanted to create a solution that makes skincare more accessible, affordable, and attainable for people frustrated with the current overcomplicated skincare landscape.

## The Team

Our team all met via Yale Launch, a student entrepreneurship club dedicated to helping students create ventures and startups. All of us loved skincare and wanted to tackle a problem in this realm. While we all did not have definitive roles and worked on much of the observations, research, and first product prototyping together, each of us had special backgrounds that contributed to our product in different ways.

**Brice (Me)** - Leader, Project Manager, UI/UX Designer

**Gauri** - Chemistry and finance background

**Xiaoke** - Marketing and startup background

## Observations and Research

We released a user survey (n = 30) to gather data on respondents' current skincare beliefs and pain points.

### Survey Demographics

We focused on a younger age range, as this group tended to be more experimental and willing to try new products. We also intentionally reached out to male surveyors since this gender demographic tended to have more users who were not as informed on skincare in comparison to the female demographic. Finally, we found that most respondents reported having a non-normal skin type, revealing how users with more problem-prone skin may show more interest in skincare.

### Survey Findings

The top reasons respondents lacked a routine were that it was too time consuming, too confusing to approach, and too overwhelming. These complaints highlight our target pain point.

For our first prototype idea, we were also interested in researching what product features users were most interested in. Separate data from users with skincare routines and users without skincare routines were collected. 

Users with skincare routines were least satisfied with cleanser(s), moisturizers, and chemical exfoliants. They were also most interested in changing or adding cleansers, masks, and serum to their routine.

Users without a skincare were most interested in trying cleansers or masks.

Both types of users expressed the top three factors that attracted them to a skincare product were the price point, brand reputation, and ease of use.

We also decided to do more market research with Mintel insight reports on what types of products consumers were most interested in. Simple usage instructions, short ingredient list, eco-ethical claims, and packaging are considerably important features for consumers ages 18-34.

## Features and Prototyping

### Product 1.0

**A set of simple, scientifically-backed, and sustainable products at an economical price that is easy to integrate into users’ everyday lives.**

#### Product 1.0 Prototyping

Using a series of four online recipes ([1](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/lavender-cleansing-milk/), [2](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/gentle-chamomile-facial-cleanser/), [3](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/houdini-anti-acne-creme/), [4)]() from blogger [Humblebee & Me](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/), our team prototyped a batch of cleansers, toners, and moisturizers. We chose this blogger for her beginner-friendly and ingredients-focused recipes. Her website had extensive information on proper ingredient sourcing, preservation of products, recipe troubleshooting, and safety precautions, so we felt that she was a trusted source.

We formed a beta testing group of 12 from our original survey respondents. Half of the testers used our “normal” skin type set, while the other half used our “acne” skin type set. Within each group, half of the normal set used X.ing products alone while the other other incorporated X.ing products into their currently existing routine. The half that used the products alone either did not originally have a routine at all or were skincare beginners willing to try a complete new routine.

Overall positive feedback on our prototype was expressed.

However, our team faced difficulty in further product development due to lack of mentorship and experience in cosmetic formulations.

These limitations and further discussion with the beta testing group users led us to discover **another pain point** that users had—the frustrations from not having convenient, reliable sources of help in discovering products or improving their routines. Although the internet contains a plethora of reviews, advice, and suggestions for different products, our users expressed more trust and a preference for help from friends or family—ultimately, people with whom they had a personal connection with and could actually look at their skin and assist them. They wanted better access to specialized, personal attention on their skin.

We decided to pivot to a new idea that would help tackle this problem.

### Pivot to Product 2.0

**A digital social platform dedicated to helping users connect with other skincare enthusiasts and skincare professionals to formulate routines, diagnose issues, and generate closer connections with people who have a shared love of skincare.**

Although online communities dedicated to skincare exist like various subreddits or forums like acne.org, there is no platform dedicated to more personalized help in discovering skincare products and formulating skincare routines.

Designed for people of all levels of skincare expertise, this platform provides a way for beginners to navigate the confusing skincare landscape while also giving more experienced skincare users the opportunity to develop more personal connections with fellow enthusiasts and provide guidance to those who need it. Users will also have the option to easily connect with dermatologists, estheticians, and other skincare professionals for an additional price.

The value we deliver:

* Faster, more affordable, and more accessible than seeing a dermatologist in person
* Offers an accessible, welcome community of support to people who have skin troubles
* Gives people who are already passionate about skincare a chance to share their wisdom and help those who need it
* Gives skincare professionals another avenue of exposure and a way to develop more digital connections with patients

### Product 2.0 Prototyping

**Tools:** Figma

**Purple** was chosen for "Friends" on the X.ing platform as it is both a social-sensory and gender-neutral color. **Blue** was chosen for "Professionals" in order to convey a sense of trust and capability.

Montserrat was chosen as a clean sans-serif font that conveys simplicity and straightforwardness.

# Skincare Product Development and Mobile App Prototyping

**Duration:** December 2018 – May 2019

**Team:** Gauri Jaswal, Xiaoke Luo

**My Role:** Team Leader, Project Manager

**Key Skills:** Project Management, Skincare Product Development, UI/UX, Mobile App Prototyping, User Research

## Challenge

**Background**: Skin. It’s the largest organ of the human body, and can be the biggest source of frustration for anyone who has been a teenager and even beyond. From walking into the confusing skincare aisles of a CVS to seeing endless online advice for using over 10 products at once, my entire team has experienced the same frustrations over finding what works best for us.

My team’s personal trials and errors made us realize that the skincare industry is promoting the incorrect notion that a long, multi-step routine is necessary, effective, or even feasible for most people. We want to create a solution that makes skincare more accessible, affordable, and attainable for people frustrated with the current overcomplicated skincare landscape.

## The Team

We all met via Yale Launch, a student entrepreneurship club dedicated to helping students create ventures and startups. All of us loved skincare and wanted to tackle a problem in this realm.

## Observations and Research

User survey: According to a user survey (n=30), **the top reasons respondents lacked a routine were that it was too time consuming, too confusing to approach, and too overwhelming**. These complaints highlight our target pain point.

In terms of what products or aspects of skincare users were interested in, separate data from users with skincare routines and users without skincare routines were collected. Users with skincare routines were least satisfied with cleanser(s), moisturizers, and chemical exfoliants. They were also most interested in changing or adding cleansers, masks, and serum to their routine. Users without a skincare routine most commonly believed that was too consuming or too difficult to implement in their lives. They were most interested in trying cleansers or masks. **Both types of users expressed the top three factors that attracted them to a skincare product were price point, brand reputation, and ease of use.**

We decided to do more research on what types of products consumers were most interested in.

Mintel insight reports: Simple usage instructions, short ingredient list, eco-ethical claims, and packaging are considerably important features for consumers ages 18-34. People generally prefer multi-benefit products and according to [Mintel’s December 2017 Skincare Ingredient and Format Trends](http://academic.mintel.com/display/867899/), specialty skincare products are struggling in sales as more people are driven towards buying cleansers or moisturizers that tout the same benefits as specialty products.

4\. Showcase feature or product ideas

With all of our user and market research in mind, our first product idea came to fruition.

Product 1.0: A set of simple, scientifically-backed, and sustainable products at an economical price that is easy to integrate into users’ everyday lives.

Pivot to Product 2.0: A digital social platform dedicated to helping users connect with other skincare enthusiasts and skincare professionals to formulate routines, diagnose their issues, and generate closer connections with people who have a shared love of skincare. :)

5\. Validation and prototyping

Product 1.0: Using a series of online recipes based on all-natural ingredients, our team prototyped a batch of cleansers, toners, and moisturizers for a beta testing group of 12. Half of the testers used our “normal” skin type set, while the other half used our “acne” skin type set. Positive feedback of our products was expressed, but our team faced further difficulty in product development due to lack of mentorship and experience.

These limitations and further discussion with the beta testing group users led us to discovering another pain point that users had—the frustrations from not having convenient, reliable sources of help in discovering products or improving their routines. Although the internet contains a plethora of reviews, advice, and suggestions for different products, our users expressed more trust and a preference for help from friends or family—ultimately, people with whom they had a personal connection with and could actually look at their skin and assist them. They wanted more specialized, personal attention on their skin. We decided to pivot to a new idea that would help tackle this problem.

Product 2.0: Designed for people of all levels of skincare expertise, this platform provides a way for beginners to navigate the confusing skincare landscape while also giving more experienced skincare users the opportunity to develop more personal connections with fellow enthusiasts and provide guidance to those who need it.

Although online communities dedicated to skincare exist like various subreddits or forums like acne.org, there is no platform dedicated to more personalized help in discovering skincare products and formulating skincare routines. Our platform will provide users with help from real people and help users cut down on the trial and error through a more simplified way of discovering the most suitable products for them. It will also give users an opportunity to develop closer, direct friendships with fellow skincare enthusiasts.

7\. Sum up the results and learnings

With our first prototype, our biggest limitations came from a lack of available mentorship and experience in cosmetic formulations. Although we were able to prototype and test two working sets of products, we had difficulties in moving beyond the first iteration. In addition, further discussion with users gave us new perspective on their pain points and goals towards building a routine. These new perspectives on how users desire to seek help and find products led us to pivot towards a new solution that was also more feasible with our current skillsets and resources.

Future directions:

Since our second prototype was a spinoff of our first and the only additional user research was collected from discussions with a limited number of people, more research on how users obtain their skincare information and preferences should be conducted, from both our personal peers as well as active users of online skincare communities.

Another point of consideration is researching how more experienced skincare users would use this platform. Newbie skincare users benefit from gaining personal advice on how to start and maintain a routine, but more established users have different incentives towards participation in this type of social network. Interviews of experienced skincare users who are active contributors on online skincare communities should be conducted to discover their motivations towards being so active and willing to assist others.

As this is a recent prototype, more testing needs to be done to see how naturally users flow from page to page. A premium feature of having a network of skincare professionals (ex. Dermatologists, estheticians, etc.) to connect with is also in consideration, but further research on how receptive users and professionals are to communication should be conducted.

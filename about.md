I'm an undergrad at Yale University ('22) studying **Computing and the Arts**, a joint computer science and art major.

**Product**, **user experience**, and **design** are what I’m passionate about. I’ve always loved exploring how to create meaningful digital experiences, whether it be through interactive storytelling or visual design.

When I'm not designing, coding, or making other projects, you can find me dancing to kpop, reading webcomics, and penny boarding down the street.

Let’s get in touch if you have a project or collaboration in mind.
Currently seeking summer 2020 opportunities!

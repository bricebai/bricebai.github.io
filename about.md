I'm an undergrad at Yale University ('22) studying **Computing and the Arts**, a joint computer science and art major.

I’ve always loved exploring how to create meaningful experiences, whether it be through interactive storytelling or product development. This combined with my background in computer science and art has led me to become passionate about **product**, **user experience**, and **design**.

When I'm not designing, coding, or making other projects, you can find me dancing to kpop, reading webcomics, and penny boarding down the street.

Let’s get in touch if you have a project or collaboration in mind.
Currently seeking summer 2020 opportunities!

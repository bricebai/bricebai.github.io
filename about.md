Ever since I’ve been on the internet, I’ve always loved exploring how to create meaningful digital experiences, whether it be through interactive storytelling or digital design.   
  
Currently, I'm a student at Yale University studying **Computing and the Arts**. **Product**, **user experience**, and **design** are what I’m passionate about. Let’s get in touch if you have a project in mind. :)

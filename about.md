Currently, I'm a student at Yale University studying **Computing and the Arts**. **Product**, **user experience**, and **design** are what I’m passionate about. I’ve always loved exploring how to create meaningful digital experiences, whether it be through interactive storytelling or digital design. Let’s get in touch if you have a project in mind. :)
